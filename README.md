## 🛠️ Implementation Steps
1. Created an Azure Storage Account using Azure Free Tier
2. Created a private Blob container
3. Enabled Blob versioning at the storage account level
4. Uploaded files to Azure Blob Storage
5. Generated Shared Access Signature (SAS) URLs for secure sharing
6. Verified version history and access control

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- Containers are private (no anonymous access)
- Access is controlled using SAS tokens
- SAS tokens are time-limited and permission-based
- No storage account keys exposed

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding Azure Blob Storage fundamentals
- Hands-on experience with Azure Portal
- Knowledge of cloud file security concepts
- Experience with versioning and secure sharing
- Practical exposure to real-world cloud storage architecture
